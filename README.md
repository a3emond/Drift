# Drift
“Drift is an experimental geo-enhanced social experience where users drop secret digital bottles on a world map. Each bottle unlocks under custom conditions and opens into an anonymous, ephemeral chat. Built for iOS with Firebase and a .NET worker service handling real-time presence, lifecycle, and cleanup.”
